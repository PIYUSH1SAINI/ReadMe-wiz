## ⚙️ Features

`ReadMe-wizard` automates the creation of comprehensive README.md files by:

* **Analyzing project structure:**  Identifies key files and folders within your project.
* **Gathering Git information:** Extracts project name, description (from the first line of the README.md if present), and author details.
* **Code analysis (Basic):** Parses code to identify functions (currently a very basic level of analysis in `lib/generateReadme.js`).  This could be expanded to provide more sophisticated insights.
* **Template-based generation:** Uses a predefined template (configurable in the future) to structure the README.md content.  This allows for customization and consistent formatting.
* **Modular design:** Uses separate modules for distinct functionalities, promoting maintainability and extensibility.
