## ⚙️ Features

* **Automated README generation:**  Generates a structured README.md file based on project metadata and code analysis.
* **Git integration:** Extracts project information from your Git repository (e.g., description, author).
* **Code analysis:**  Analyzes JavaScript code to identify functions and their descriptions (requires properly formatted JSDoc comments).
* **Customizable template:**  Uses a configurable template to allow for tailored README outputs.
* **Flexible output:**  Generates a markdown file ready for use on GitHub and other platforms.

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PIYUSH1SAINI/ReadMe-wizard.git
cd ReadMe-wizard
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

---

## 🛠️ Usage

1. **Navigate to the project directory:** Change your current directory to the project you want to generate a README for.

2. **Run the script:** Execute the `index.js` script from the `bin` directory:

```bash
node bin/index.js
```

This will generate a `README.md` file in your current directory.  The script will attempt to automatically analyze your code and extract information. To fully utilize the code analysis features, ensure your JavaScript files have thorough JSDoc comments.


**Example (with minimal configuration):**

For a simple project, running the script without any arguments will generate a basic README.  The script will attempt to gather as much information as it can automatically.


**Example (with custom template and configuration):**

For more advanced usage and customization, explore adding a `readme-template.md` file to the root of your project directory.  This template file can then be customized to fit your project's specific needs.
